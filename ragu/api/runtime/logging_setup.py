"""
Route the service's logs into RAGU's loguru sink.

The engines log through loguru while uvicorn, httpx and the OpenAI client log
through stdlib ``logging``. Without this the two halves of one request land in
different sinks with different formats, and a trace cannot be followed across
them. Installing an intercept handler on the stdlib root gives the whole
process a single sink.

Only ``python -m ragu.api`` calls :func:`configure_logging`. Importing
``create_app`` into another server leaves that server's logging alone.
